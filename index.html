      <h2>What if the simple pleasures of our lives suddenly became privileges? </h2>

        Originally commenting on the observation of the overwhelming quantity of side effects in necessary medications
        used majority by women (such as birth control), aTasteofHerMedicine is a project on the lack of research and
        funding into women’s health.
  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are sixteen years of history that completely excluded women from clinical trials — the consequences of which
        are still felt today. The number one cause of death for American women is cardiovascular disease, yet women only
        make up one third of participants in clinical trials. Even though 80% of health care decisions are made by women,
        the budget for women-focused research is heavily disproportionate — such as at 4.5% for coronary artery disease
        and 7% for rheumatoid arthritis.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this gap can become an opportunity. Doubling the budget for women-focused heart disease could expect a
        9,500% return on investment, and doubling that for arthritis could deliver a 174,000% return on investment adding
        $10.5B to the economy. Learn more at https://whamnow.org/.
